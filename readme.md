# Generals.io 1v1 match helper

This is a tampermonkey script for generals.io
The purpose is to make top players have better experience while playing 1v1.
The auto match button is one of the useful buttons, which can automatically help you join the 1v1 queue when you have turned on the button and someone(i.e. finding range) you prefer to play with just finished a 1v1 game.
Also, it can't guarantee that you will match the people you what to play with (but it will help you match he/she with a high probablity) and it will also automatically leave the 1v1 queue if you have waited for longer than 10 seconds.

Friend list is put in localStorage, so the list won't be lost after refreshing the page.

I have tested this script **in chrome**, but not in other browsers. You can have a try if you want.
